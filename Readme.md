## 📖 Overview

This project uses **Monte Carlo simulation** to predict gold price movements and quantify risk. It combines 5 advanced stochastic models with real market data, professional risk analytics, an interactive Streamlit dashboard, and a full command-line interface.

The system mirrors tools used by professional quantitative traders and hedge funds — calibrating models from historical data, simulating thousands of possible price futures, and extracting probability distributions and risk metrics from the results.

## ⚠️ Warning!!
the price it's per troy ounce :
1 troy ounce = 31.1 grams
so :
(the price showen in the simulation) ÷ 31.1035 = ~the price per gram

## 🧠 The 5 Stochastic Models

### 1. Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)
```
dS = μ·S·dt + σ·S·dW
```
The foundational model. Assumes log-normally distributed returns with constant drift and volatility. Used as a **baseline benchmark**.

### 2. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck — Mean Reversion ⭐ Most important for gold
```
dS = κ·(θ − S)·dt + σ·dW
```
Captures gold's documented tendency to revert to long-term equilibrium. `κ` controls the speed of reversion, `θ` is the long-term fair value. **Best for long-term forecasting.**

### 3. Merton Jump Diffusion
```
dS = μ·S·dt + σ·S·dW + J·S·dN
```
Extends GBM with a Poisson jump process to model sudden price shocks from geopolitical crises or central bank interventions. **Best for risk analysis and stress testing.**

### 4. Heston Stochastic Volatility
```
dS = μ·S·dt + √v·S·dW₁
dv = κ(θ−v)·dt + ξ·√v·dW₂
```
Models volatility itself as a stochastic process, capturing volatility clustering and the leverage effect. **Best for options pricing and volatility forecasting.**

### 5. Regime Switching (Markov Chain)
```
dS = μ(sₜ)·S·dt + σ(sₜ)·S·dW
```
Alternates between distinct market states (calm / crisis) using a Markov chain. Each regime has its own drift and volatility parameters. **Best for scenario planning.**

## 💻 CLI Reference

```
python cli.py <command> [options]

Commands:
  price      Show current live gold price
  simulate   Run Monte Carlo simulation
  risk       Deep risk analysis (VaR, CVaR, drawdowns)
  backtest   Walk-forward backtest across models
  compare    Side-by-side model comparison

Common Options:
  --model   -m    Model: gbm | ou | merton | heston | regime
  --days    -d    Forecast horizon in trading days (default: 30)
  --paths   -p    Number of simulation paths (default: 5000)
  --period        Training data: 6mo | 1y | 2y | 5y (default: 2y)

  --seed          Random seed for reproducibility (default: 42)
```

### Examples

```bash
# Quick 7-day forecast with GBM
python cli.py simulate --model gbm --days 7

# 1-year Heston simulation, save results
python cli.py simulate --model heston --days 252 --paths 10000 --output forecast.json

# Risk analysis with price target
python cli.py risk --model ou --days 90 --target 2800

## 📊 Risk Metrics Explained

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **VaR 95%** | Maximum loss expected 95% of the time |
| **CVaR 95%** | Average loss in the worst 5% of scenarios |
| **Max Drawdown** | Worst peak-to-trough price drop across all paths |
| **90% CI** | Range containing 90% of all simulated final prices |
| **Prob. of Gain** | % of paths where final price > current price |
| **Realised Vol** | Annualised standard deviation of simulated returns |

---

## 🔬 Backtesting Methodology

The backtester uses **walk-forward analysis** — the industry standard for validating time series models without lookahead bias:

```
├── Training Window (252 days default)  →  Calibrate model parameters
├── Test Window    (30 days default)    →  Evaluate out-of-sample predictions
└── Step forward by test window size    →  Repeat across full history
```

**Accuracy metrics:**

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| RMSE | √mean((pred − actual)²) | Lower is better |
| MAE | mean(\|pred − actual\|) | Lower is better |
| MAPE | mean(\|error/actual\|) × 100 | < 5% is good |
| Directional Accuracy | % correct up/down calls | > 55% is good |

## 🛠️ Usage as a Python Package

```python
from src.models import create_model
from src.data.fetcher import GoldDataFetcher
from src.data.cleaner import DataCleaner

# Fetch and clean data
fetcher = GoldDataFetcher()
raw     = fetcher.fetch_gold_prices('GC=F', period='2y')
cleaner = DataCleaner()
prices  = cleaner.clean_price_data(raw)

# Create and calibrate model
model = create_model('ou', historical_data=prices['close'].values)

# Simulate 10,000 paths for 30 days
paths = model.simulate(S0=2350.0, n_steps=30, n_paths=10000)

# Results
import numpy as np
final_prices = paths[:, -1]
print(f"Expected price: ${np.mean(final_prices):,.2f}")
print(f"95% CI: [${np.percentile(final_prices,5):,.2f}, ${np.percentile(final_prices,95):,.2f}]")
print(f"Prob. of gain:  {np.mean(final_prices > 2350)*100:.1f}%")
```
